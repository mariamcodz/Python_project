Data Mining for Bird Sound Database

Chapter 1. Introduction

•	The motivation and background of the research

•	Problem statements

•	The aim and objectives

GENERAL OVERVIEW/MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROJECT
Pick a specie e.g., Robin which may have 500 records, and do an analysis on those records e.g., Length and Location distribution.
o	To understand the time of the day which is affected by the season (if you take a data set from (e.g., Jan - April) Robin sings all year round. Another bird Chiffchaff (how many times it calls during the day from Jan - March, gets the distribution. If it is affected by the daylight when we have longer and shorter days. In January, they start singing from 8 am – 4 pm. If there’s enough data, how many hours they sing in a day and the distribution from Jan – Dec for all month and time of the day. During summer, it starts singing from 4 am – 10 pm during summer because it's daylight.

o	Also, pick a specie (Chifchaf) that migrates from West Africa around April i.e., April – June, and stop then migrate back to West Africa in September, to see very different distribution patterns. Go back in time and see how climate change is significantly affecting migration. Do they arrive In the UK 20 days earlier than they do 15 – 20 years ago because the springs are getting warmer and they start getting warmer and the birds start migrating earlier?

o	E.G., In the year 2000, 21st of March the first birds arrive in 2001, they arrive 1 day early, In 2002, they arrive 2 days early till 2022 when they migrate and arrive 22 days earlier because of climate change so they arrived by April now.
o	Test this against …….They take about a week to fly from West Africa to Europe and when they arrive, they are very cold and most may die. Migration Timing is really important. If it gets warmer, you see the birds staying all year round, as the winter is getting warmer. The birds are small and little weighing about 7 grams. If they arrive and it's cold and there is no food, they may die.

o	To get audio files that show the specific time the bird calls, a mating danger call. A robin called at 8:34 am at this location. The distribution of bird calls in a day and so some statistical data analysis representation on it to find answers from 46k records downloaded.


METADATA/VARIABLES TO BE USED
“ID” - Identification number of the bird
“Gen” – Generic name of the bird specie
“SP” – Specific name of the bird Specie
“Loc” – Location of the bird
“Type” – e.g Adult, male, song
“Length” – How long they cry e.g 2:32 mins
“Time” – The time of the day they cry e.g 6:30
“Date” – 18 -06 -1994
“Uploaded” – When it was uploaded


AIM (WHAT WE WANT TO ACHIEVE)
_ To understand how the time of the day (season: Summer, winter) affects the bird. E.g., We take a dataset from Jan – April and check how many times they sing by checking how many hours they sing in a day 

_ To understand/demonstrate how climate change affects the bird’s location/migration timing distribution pattern. E.g., we will check for birds that migrate from West African to Europe and how climate change has affected them i.e., if in recent years they come to the UK 20 days earlier than in the last 10 – 15 years maybe because the spring s get warmer and they start arriving earlier.
_ To demonstrate and do some statistical analysis on the frequency distribution of a bird call in a day. i.e., to get audio files that shows the specific time the bird calls, e.g., a mating call or danger call.
_ Demonstrate how climate change Is affecting how they migrate (time and is the climate change causing to change the time they arrive. Is the heat affecting their migration? It has a long effect on their survival rate.
_ Show the kind of change impacting the bird’s behavior based on the two questions below:
-	Are they arriving earlier and are they leaving later? Are there some birds that stay over in winter?
-	Does some of the birds wait for all through the summer in 2015 but by 2019 they left before summer ended
-	Does some stay till the end of summer and leave till summer almost ended?

STATISTICS TO LOOK OUT FOR
*The time the birds arrive for Migrating birds
* The frequency of calls in a day
* The time distribution by Month and by the hour
* Their behavior and what we can interpret from it.
OTHER STATISTICS
Frequency, time of the day, weather, morphology, how often the birds call, when they call, migration, birds are singing. Time of the year, time of the day, do they stop singing during winter
